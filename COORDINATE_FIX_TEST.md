# ✅ RESOLVED - See COORDINATE_SOLUTION.md

## Final Solution

The coordinate issue has been **completely resolved** by implementing Google's official coordinate conversion method.

**See `COORDINATE_SOLUTION.md` for the complete solution.**

## What Was Fixed

1. **Removed complex aspect ratio correction** - not needed
2. **Removed coordinate swap testing** - not needed  
3. **Implemented Google's simple method**: `pixel = (coordinate / 1000) * dimension`
4. **Verified against Google's official example code**

## Result

✅ Bounding boxes now perfectly align with products  
✅ Works for all image aspect ratios (portrait, landscape, square)  
✅ Clean, maintainable code matching Google's recommendations

# Coordinate Fix Testing Guide

## The Problem

Bounding boxes from Gemini product detection are misaligned with actual products. We've implemented two coordinate conversion methods to test which one works correctly.

## Two Coordinate Conversion Methods

### Method 1: Simple Conversion (Aspect: OFF) ✅ WINNER
Assumes Gemini normalizes coordinates 0-1000 independently for each axis based on actual image dimensions.

```javascript
leftPx = (x0 / 1000) * imageWidth
topPx = (y0 / 1000) * imageHeight
```

**Result:** This is the correct method and matches Google's official recommendation.

### Method 2: Aspect Ratio Correction (Aspect: ON) ❌ NOT NEEDED
Assumed Gemini uses a 1000x1000 square coordinate space, requiring adjustment for non-square images.

**Result:** This correction is unnecessary. Gemini respects actual image dimensions.

## Test Results

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Solution:** Simple conversion method (Google's official approach)

| Method | Result | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Simple (Aspect OFF) | ✅ Works | Matches Google's official example |
| Aspect Correction (Aspect ON) | ❌ Not needed | Added unnecessary complexity |

**Final Decision:** Use simple conversion matching Google's official code

**Implementation:** Completed in commit e82fc7b
