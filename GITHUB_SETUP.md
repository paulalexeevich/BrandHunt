### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: **BrangHunt**
3. Description: **AI-powered product detection with Gemini and FoodGraph API**

After creating, you'll see a URL like:
- HTTPS: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BrangHunt.git`
- SSH: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/BrangHunt.git`

### 3. Run These Commands in Terminal

```bash

# Add GitHub as remote (replace with YOUR repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/BrangHunt.git
